  abstract = "Regular grids or lattices are frequently used to study
              ecosystems, for observations, experiments and simulations. The
              regular rectangular or square grid is used more often than the
              hexagonal grid, but their relative merits have been little
              discussed. Here we compare rectangular and hexagonal grids for
              ecological applications. We focus on the reasons some researchers
              have preferred hexagonal grids and methods to facilitate the use
              of hexagonal grids. We consider modeling and other applications,
              including the role of nearest neighborhood in experimental
              design, the representation of connectivity in maps, and a new
              method for performing field surveys using hexagonal grids, which
              was demonstrated on montane heath vegetation. The rectangular
              grid is generally preferred because of its symmetrical,
              orthogonal co-ordinate system and the frequent use of rasters
              from Geographic Information Systems. Cells in a rectangular grid
              can also easily be combined to produce new grids with lower
              resolutions. However, efficient co-ordinate systems and
              multi-resolution partitions using the hexagonal grid are
              available. The nearest neighborhood in a hexagonal grid is
              simpler and less ambiguous than in a rectangular grid. When
              nearest neighborhood, movement paths or connectivity are
              important, the rectangular grid may not be suitable. We also
              investigate important differences between visualizations using
              hexagonal and rectangular grids. A survey of recent uses of grids
              in Ecological Modeling suggested that hexagonal grids are rarely
              used, even in applications for which they are more suitable than
              rectangular grids, e.g. connectivity and movement paths.
              Researchers should consider their choice of grid at an early
              stage in project development, and authors should explain the
              reasons for their choices.",

                   action values under certain conditions. It was not
                   previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations
                   are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they
                   can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all
                   these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show
                   that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning
                   with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial
                   overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We
                   then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning
                   algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be
                   generalized to work with large-scale function approximation.
                   We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and
                   show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the
                   observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this
                   also leads to much better performance on several games.",

  abstract = "Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by
              providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody,
              anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential
              for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy
              consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models,
              however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing.
              Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of
              car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per
              vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more
              general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity
              ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and
              trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect
              to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from
              a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained
              optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and
              converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify
              experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting
              time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to
              medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The
              algorithm is validated with âˆ¼3 million rides extracted from the
              New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study
              considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10
              simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to
              fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing
              of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is
              general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle,

                     such platforms is and what power and means the platform
                     has in shaping these distributions. In this paper, we
                     analyze job assignments of a major taxi company and
                     observe that there is significant inequality in the driver
                     income distribution. We propose a novel framework to think
                     about fairness in the matching mechanisms of ride hailing
                     platforms. Specifically, our notion of fairness relies on
                     the idea that, spread over time, all drivers should
                     receive benefits proportional to the amount of time they
                     are active in the platform. We postulate that by not
                     requiring every match to be fair, but rather distributing
                     fairness over time, we can achieve better overall benefit
                     for the drivers and the passengers. We experiment with
                     various optimization problems and heuristics to explore
                     the means of achieving two-sided fairness, and investigate
                     their caveats and side-effects. Overall, our work takes
                     the first step towards rethinking fairness in ride hailing
                     platforms with an additional emphasis on the well-being of
                     drivers.",

              ride-sharing platform that serves a network of locations. Riders
              are heterogeneous in terms of their destination preferences and
              their willingness to pay for receiving service. Drivers decide
              whether, when, and where to provide service so as to maximize
              their expected earnings, given the platform's prices. Our
              findings highlight the impact of the demand pattern on the
              platform's prices, profits, and the induced consumer surplus. In
              particular, we establish that profits and consumer surplus are
              maximized when the demand pattern is ``balanced'' across the
              network's locations. In addition, we show that they both increase
              monotonically with the balancedness of the demand pattern (as
              formalized by its structural properties). Furthermore, if the
              demand pattern is not balanced, the platform can benefit
              substantially from pricing rides differently depending on the

               demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode
               of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute
               vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow
               for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have
               primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to
               pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle
               vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the
               contrary has received little attention in the context of
               ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance
               idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled MoD fleet. This method
               consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet
               operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to
               determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using
               incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment
               of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer
               linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from
               Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8\% of taxi requests in
               Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of
               57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds.
               Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000
               vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a
               fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by
               86\%, the average waiting time by 37\%, and the amount of
               ignored requests by 95\% compared to earlier work at the expense
               of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.",

               in deep reinforcement learning. Allowing the agent to learn from
               earlier memories can speed up learning and break undesirable
               temporal correlations. Despite its widespread application, very
               little is understood about the properties of experience replay.
               How does the amount of memory kept affect learning dynamics?
               Does it help to prioritize certain experiences? In this paper,
               we address these questions by formulating a dynamical systems
               ODE model of Q-learning with experience replay. We derive
               analytic solutions of the ODE for a simple setting. We show that
               even in this very simple setting, the amount of memory kept can
               substantially affect the agent's performance-too much or too
               little memory both slow down learning. Moreover, we characterize
               regimes where prioritized replay harms the agent's learning. We
               show that our analytic solutions have excellent agreement with
               experiments. Finally, we propose a simple algorithm for

  abstract = "This paper presents a novel multiagent approach to automating
              taxi dispatch that services current bookings in a distributed
              fashion. The existing system in use by a taxi operator in
              Singapore and elsewhere, attempts to increase customer
              satisfaction locally, by sequentially dispatching nearby taxis to
              service customers. The proposed dispatch system attempts to
              increase customer satisfaction more globally, by concurrently
              dispatching multiple taxis to the same number of customers in the
              same geographical region, andvis-{\`a}-vishuman driver
              satisfaction. To realize the system, a multiagent architecture is
              proposed, populated with software collaborative agents that can
              actively negotiate on behalf of taxi drivers in groups of size N
              for available customer bookings. Theoretically, an analysis of
              the boundary and optimal multiagent taxi-dispatch situations is
              presented along with a discussion of their implications.
              Experimentally, the operational efficiency of the existing and
              proposed dispatch systems was evaluated through computer

               customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves
               to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network.
               We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson
               network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal
               rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously)
               rebalancing vehicles while keeping vehicle availabilities
               balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear
               program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust,
               real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case
               study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle
               mobile robot testbed. The case study of New York shows that the
               current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000
               robotic vehicles (roughly 70\% of the size of the current taxi
               fleet operating in Manhattan). Finally, we extend our
               queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and
               study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall
               congestion. Using a simple heuristic algorithm, we show that
               additional congestion due to autonomous rebalancing can be
               effectively avoided on a road network. Collectively, this paper
               provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide

               each booking is the one with the shortest, direct, straight-line

                   mechanisms for such marketplaces from the perspective of
                   drivers, presenting the theoretical foundation that has
                   informed the design of Uber's new additive driver surge
                   mechanism. We present a dynamic stochastic model to capture

              such as Lyft, Sidecar, and Uber. Analysis of pricing in such
              settings is complex: On one hand these platforms are two-sided --
              this requires economic models that capture the incentives of both
              drivers and passengers. On the other hand, these platforms
              support high temporal-resolution for data collection and pricing
              -- this requires stochastic models that capture the dynamics of

              two main results: We first show that performance (throughput and
              revenue) under any dynamic pricing strategy cannot exceed that
              under the optimal static pricing policy (i.e., one which is
              agnostic of stochastic fluctuations in the system load). This
              result belies the prevalence of dynamic pricing in practice. Our
              second result explains the apparent paradox: we show that dynamic
              pricing is much more robust to fluctuations in system parameters
              compared to static pricing. Thus dynamic pricing does not
              necessarily yield higher performance than static pricing --

              capabilities, demand-side admission control and supply-side
              repositioning control, on performance from the platform's,

              network that highlights two practically important
              characteristics: (i) there is significant demand imbalance across
              locations, such that the natural supply of drivers ending trips
              at a location is insufficient to serve the local rider demand, as
              is common during peak hours in urban areas; and (ii) drivers are
              self-interested and strategically decide whether to join the
              network, and if so, when and where to reposition themselves when
              not serving riders. We provide the following results in the
              context of a novel model: (1) Considering the steady-state fluid
              network model equations, we fully characterize the drivers'
              incentive compatibility conditions for repositioning decisions,
              and the system equilibrium under three control regimes, ranging
              from minimal platform control, to centralized admission and
              repositioning control. (2) We provide new insights on the
              interplay between admission control and drivers' strategic
              repositioning decisions: it may be optimal to strategically
              reject demand at the low-demand location, although there is an
              excess supply of drivers, to induce repositioning to the
              high-demand location. We provide necessary and sufficient
              conditions for this policy. (3) We derive bounds on the
              platform's and the drivers' achievable performance benefits due
              to platform controls; these are more significant when capacity is
              moderate, and when cross-location demand imbalance is

              problem faced in the short-term by a ride-hailing platform. We
              propose a two-dimensional framework in which a platform selects
              prices for different locations, and drivers respond by choosing
              where to relocate in equilibrium based on prices, travel costs
              and driver congestion levels.The platform's problem is an
              infinite-dimensional optimization problem with equilibrium
              constraints. We elucidate structural properties of supply
              equilibria and the corresponding utilities that emerge and
              establish a form of spatial decomposition, which allows us to
              localize the analysis to regions of movement. In turn, uncovering
              an appropriate knapsack structure to the platform's problem, we
              establish a crisp local characterization of the optimal prices
              and the corresponding supply response. In the optimal solution
              the platform applies different treatments to different locations.
              In some locations, prices are set so that supply and demand are
              perfectly matched; over-congestion is induced in other locations,
              and some less profitable locations are indirectly priced out. To
              obtain insights on the global structure of an optimal solution,
              we derive in quasi-closed form the optimal solution for a family
              of models characterized by a demand shock. The optimal solution,

              tremendous attention from the research community and are
              continuously being designed and implemented at industrial scales
              by ride-hailing platforms. We provide a review of matching and
              dynamic pricing techniques in ride-hailing, and show that they
              are critical for providing an experience with low waiting time
              for both riders and drivers. Then we link the two levers together
              by studying a pool-matching mechanism called dynamic waiting that
              varies rider waiting and walking before dispatch, which is
              inspired by a recent carpooling product Express Pool from Uber.
              We show using data from Uber that by jointly optimizing dynamic
              pricing and dynamic waiting, price variability can be mitigated,
              while increasing capacity utilization, trip throughput, and
              welfare. We also highlight several key practical challenges and
              directions of future research from a practitioner's perspective.",

               recently emerged on-line ride-hailing, it has been a major
               challenge to improve the ride-hailing marketplace efficiency due
               to spatio-temporal imbalance between the supply and demand,
               among other factors. Despite the numerous approaches to improve
               marketplace efficiency using pricing and dispatch strategies,
               they usually optimize pricing or dispatch separately. In this
               paper, we show that these two processes are in fact
               intrinsically interrelated. Motivated by this observation, we
               make an attempt to simultaneously optimize pricing and dispatch
               strategies. However, such a joint optimization is extremely
               challenging due to the inherent huge scale and lack of a uniform
               model of the problem. To handle the high complexity brought by
               the new problem, we propose InBEDE (Integrating contextual
               Bandit with tEmporal DiffErence learning), a learning framework
               where pricing strategies are learned via a contextual bandit
               algorithm, and the dispatch strategies are optimized with the
               help of temporal difference learning. The two learning
               components proceed in a mutual bootstrapping manner, in the
               sense that the policy evaluations of the two components are
               inter-dependent. Evaluated with real-world datasets of two
               Chinese cities from Didi Chuxing, an online ride-hailing
               platform, we show that the market efficiency of the ride-hailing
               platform can be significantly improved using InBEDE.",
